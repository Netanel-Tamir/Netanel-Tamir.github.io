Iâ€™m a computer science PhD student at Tel Aviv University. 

I hold an MSc in computer science & mathematics from the Weizmann Institute of Science, where I was fortunate enough to be advised by <a href="https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/dekel/home">Prof. Tali Dekel</a>, and also work with <a href="https://richzhang.github.io/">Dr. Richard Zhang</a> and <a href="https://web.mit.edu/phillipi/">Prof. Phillip Isola</a>. During my studies, I also completed an internship at Apple.

Before that, I completed my BSc in computer science at Bar-Ilan University (Summa Cum Laude).

I am passionate about a broad range of topics including computer vision, representation learning, virtual reality, and psychophysics.

I'm also a master sergeant in the Israeli Artillery Corps reserves. <img src="assets/img/red-black.png" style="
